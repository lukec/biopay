# Biopay

Biopay is a software system to operate a biodiesel cardlock for a group of
people.

Biopay interfaces with a CardMasterâ„¢ Cardlock over a really long serial cable. It
stores everything in a CouchDB.  Biopay has a web application component, as well
as background daemons to monitor the cardlock as well as other jobs such as 
payment processing.
